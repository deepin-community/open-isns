Testing
=======

This directory contains the isnsd selftests. Binaries needed for
testing are created by "make all" one level above this, in the main
isnsd compilation directory. The Makefile here is a convenience for
running the selftests using perl.

The isnsd tests must be run as root. You do not need the isnsd
service running, as the tests start/stop their own daemon.

Running "make" or "make tests" here runs all the tests, in
shell-sorted-name order, one at a time, in "quiet" mode. Running "make
quick" here runs the tests in "quiet" and "quick" mode. Several of the
tests internally set the "insecure" option. You can of course run any
of the tests in any order by manually calling them, i.e. running
"perl testNN.pl".

To run all of the tests when security is disabled, use the "-i"
flag for each of the tests, or run "make tests-no-security".

Options supported by the test scripts:
-q/--quiet	quiet		only show test name and results
-v/--verbose	verbose		show verbose test info and results
-f/--fast	fast		skip tests longer than 15 seconds
-i/--insecure	insecure	don't use keys?
